We were struck with the installation  of Cluster Essentials as we could not execute the commands in windows. Later in linux, we started running one by one.

We firstly ran the cluster using Azure kubernetes service and connected it with azure cli in linux.
We have completed installing the following:

cluster essentials
tanzu cli

Later, we added the Tanzu Application Platform package repository by following the commands as specified in the vmware site.

Now, currently we are working in Tanzu Application Platform profile installation.
